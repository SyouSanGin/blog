# The maxima of the periodic sum in a sequence (one dimension)
## An importand concept: Valid Sequense
It means a sequence that generated by the method below:
- If 
$$
a_{n+1}+S_{n} \ge a_{n+1}
$$
$S_n$above is the sum of the elements whose index are less than or equal n.Then add $a_{n+1}$ to the sequence and update the value of $S_{n+1}$.
- If
$$
a_{n+1}+S_{n} < a_{n+1}
$$
Then update the $S_{n+1} = a_{n+1}$ and clear the sequence before add the $a_{n+1}$ to it. (Means $Seq = \{a_{n+1}\}$)
